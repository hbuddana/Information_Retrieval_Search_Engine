# Information_Retrieval Search Engine üîç

## Search Engine for unt.edu
This project implements a search engine for the University of North Texas (unt.edu) using a vector space retrieval model. The search engine crawls and parses web pages from unt.edu to build a dictionary of terms for efficient retrieval.

## Features
Vector space retrieval model: The search engine utilizes a vector space model to index and retrieve relevant documents based on query terms.
Web crawling and parsing: The search engine includes a web crawler and parser that collects webpages from unt.edu and extracts relevant terms for indexing.
Term-based search: Users can input queries, and the search engine returns a ranked list of documents based on term relevance.
Evaluation of system: The system allows for evaluating the search results by comparing them with the original unt.edu search.

## Usage
Once the search engine is up and running, you can perform searches by following these steps:

- Enter your query in the search box on the search engine interface.
- Click the "Search" button or press Enter.
- The search engine will retrieve and rank relevant documents based on the query.
- View the search results, which will include the document title, snippet, and link.


## Evaluation üìë
To evaluate the search engine's performance, follow these steps:

- Select a word or query of your choice.
- Perform the same query on the original unt.edu search engine.
- Perform the query on your system using the search engine you've implemented.
- Compare the search results and note any discrepancies or differences.
